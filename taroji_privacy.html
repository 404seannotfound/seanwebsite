  <h1>Privacy Policy for Taroji</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 1, 2025</p>

  <p>
    Taroji does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
    We do not track you, log your behavior, or send any information to third-party
    servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    All content generated within the app â€” including text inputs, emoji spreads, and
    AI-powered readings â€” stays on your device or is sent directly from your device
    to the OpenAI API <em>only</em> when you provide your own API key.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your API key is stored securely on your device and is never transmitted to our
    servers, because Taroji has no servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe in privacy by default. This app exists purely to offer creative,
    introspective, and mystical fun â€” not to harvest your data.
  </p>

  <p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact the developer.</p>

  <p>Thank you for using Taroji. ðŸŒŸ</p>
